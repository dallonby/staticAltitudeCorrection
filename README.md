# staticAltitudeCorrection
A method for correcting the barometric altitude of a moving platform by using a static barometer with a radio link, recording data alongside a mobile barometer.  One use of said method could be in apparatus for performance testing of human powered vehicles.

Difference between static and mobile data are compared and a altitude computed which includes differential correction data from the static barometer.

Our second method uses a barometer on a moving platform alongside one on static device, with both recording timestamped barometric data for later analysis offline.  Again, one use of said method could be in apparatus for performance testing of human powered vehicles.
